    <p class="info"> According to Jaylen, His most prized achievement was graduating from the University
        of Houston for music. Jaylen Had picked up music production as a kid, and was entirely 
        self-taught in production for some time, but then decided to the next level and get a 
        degree for it. With all of his newfound knowledge upon exiting school, Jaylen has 
        started his own studio out in Houston Texas. His studio has been a success, but one 
        of Jaylen's main goals is to start his own luxury car sales lot.
