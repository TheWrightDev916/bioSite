    <!--write up about Jaylen-->
  
        <p class="info2">Jaylen Wyatt is a 27-year-old music producer from Missouri City Texas. 
        He currently resides in the city of Houston Texas where he owns a music 
        studio. Jaylen choose to become a music producer at a young age. He grew 
        up around many other around of capitals of the music world but choose to 
        start producing his own music when he did not agree with the music that 
        was being put out at the time. This is where he had turned to learning 
        how to produce sounds on his own from a software at home, where he later 
        pursued a degree in music from the University of Houston. If Jaylen had 
        the chance to do anything else in life, he would like to become a software
        developer. Jaylen enjoys spending time programming things on the computer 
         and watching it come to life as it develops. He enjoys learning the languages
         and write ups of the coding world, but also shared that he has a form of 
         color blindness called Tritanopia. This is a condition where a person cannot
         distinguish between blue and yellow colors. Jaylen says one of his goals 
         is to create a more tailored program towards those with the same condition.
        One day he also wishes to merge his current hobby and profession of music
        production and programming to help promote both two together along with 
        creating his own car rental business. Jaylen has several hobbies of his own
         of course aside from music and software development. In his spare time, he 
         likes to play airsoft, and he also enjoys playing a space game Called Star
          Citizen where he gets to escape current reality for a while.
