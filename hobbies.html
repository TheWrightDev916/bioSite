<!--Hobbies and interest-->
  <p class="info3"> After having a career in the music industry, he later realized that he also enjoys Software Development. Instead of 
    going back to school and getting a degree for computer science as well, Jaylen has 
    chosen to code as one of his hobbies and become self-taught until further notice. One 
    of his other main hobbies, he enjoys is playing Airsoft. Jaylen says some of his better
   days are spent on the field shooting at other people in a non-lethal matter for the sport. 
   Also, after long days of work, he says his main hobby consist of being in space in a video 
   game called star citizen, where he can temporarily leave earth and have an out of this world experience.
